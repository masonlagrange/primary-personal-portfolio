# Mason Lagrange Personal Portfolio

## Description 
 
This project is to showcase my web development portfolio. I haven't done many projects yet so there are a few placeholder, but this project will be updated as my portfolio increases. This is an excercise in creating a project from scratch to better understand every part of what must be done to create a full webpage.
